          Have you been wondering how to become a web developer?<br />

          Contrary to a popular belief, you don’t need a fancy bachelor’s degree

          website.<br />

          In fact, if you follow this tutorial, you will become a web developer
          a lot quicker than you think (but it will still take some hard
          work!).<br />

        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It’s one of the main
          ingredients of any website and one of the so-called frontend
          languages.<br />

          In short – it provides the basic skeleton of a website, mainly through
          a series of tags.<br />

          A tag is the HTML code that controls the appearance of the HTML
          document’s content.<br />

        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br />

          It puts the style behind the HTML structure. Basically, without CSS,
          HTML, and consequently, the whole web page would look boring.<br />

          Here’s how they combine: Within your HTML code, you reference a CSS
          style sheet. <br />

        <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
        <p>
          Javascript is a programming language that allows you to implement
          elements on web pages.<br />
          It powers features like interactive maps, 2D/3D graphics, and more.
