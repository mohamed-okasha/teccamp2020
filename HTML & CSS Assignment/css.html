      <h2 class="contentTitleCss">1. Inline CSS</h2>
      <p>
        First off, we can include CSS directly in our HTML elements. For this,
        we make use of the style attribute and then we provide properties to it.
      </p>

      <div class="CSSexample">
        &lt;h1 style="color: blue"> Hello world! &lt;/h1>
      </div>

      <p>
        Here we’re giving it the property of color, and setting the value to
        blue.
      </p>

      <h2 class="contentTitleCss">2. Internal CSS</h2>
      <p>
        The other way to include CSS is using the style element in the head
        section of the HTML document. This is called internal styling.
      </p>

      <div class="CSSexample">
        &lt;head> &lt;style> h1 { color: blue; } &lt;/style> &lt;/head>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the style element, we can give the styling to our HTML elements by
        selecting the element(s) and provide styling attributes. Just like we
        applied thecolorproperty to the h1 element above.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2 class="contentTitleCss">3. External CSS</h2>
      <p>
        The third and most recommended way to include CSS is using an external
        stylesheet. We create a stylesheet with a .css extension and include its
        link in the HTML document, like this:
      </p>

      <div class="CSSexample">
        &lt;head> &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> &lt;/head>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the code above, we have included the link of style.css file using the
        link element. We then write all of our CSS in a separate stylesheet
        called style.css so that it’s easily manageable.
      </p>

      <div class="CSSexample">
        h1 { color: blue; }
      </div>
      <p>
        This stylesheet can also be imported into other HTML files, so this is
        great for reusability.
      </p>

      <h2 class="contentTitleCss">CSS Selectors</h2>
      <p>
        As we discussed earlier, CSS is a design language which is used to style
        HTML elements. And in order to style elements, you first have to select
        them. You’ve already seen a glimpse of how this works, but let’s dive a
        bit deeper into CSS selectors, and look at three different ways you can
        select HTML elements.
      </p>
      <h2 class="contentTitleCss">1. Element</h2>
      <p>
        The first way to select an HTML element is by simply using the name,
        which is what we did above. Let’s see how it works:
      </p>
      <div class="CSSexample">
        h1 { font-size: 20px; } p { color: green; } div { margin: 10px; }
      </div>
      <p>
        The example above is almost self-explanatory. We are selecting different
        elements like h1, p, div and giving them different style attributes. The
        font-size controls the size of the text, color sets the text color, and
        margin adds spacing around the element.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2 class="contentTitleCss">2. Class</h2>
      <p>
        Another way of selecting HTML elements is by using the class attribute.
        In HTML, we can assign different classes to our elements. Each element
        can have multiple classes, and each class can also be applied to
        multiple elements as well.<br />
        Let’s see it in action:
      </p>
      <div class="CSSexample">
        &lt;div class='container'> &lt;h1> This is heading &lt;/h1> &lt;/div>
      </div>
      <div class="CSSexample">
        .container { margin: 10px; }
      </div>
      <p>
        In the code above, we have assigned the class of container to the div
        element. In the stylesheet, we select our class using .className format
        and giving it a 10px margin.
      </p>
      <h2 class="contentTitleCss">2. ID</h2>
      <p>
        Like classes, we can also use IDs to select HTML elements and apply
        styling to them. The only difference between class and ID is that one ID
        can be assigned to only one HTML element.
      </p>
      <div class="CSSexample">
        &lt;div> &lt;p id='para1'> This is a paragraph &lt;/p> &lt;/div>
      </div>
      <div class="CSSexample">
        #para1 { color: green; font-size: 16px; }
      </div>
      <p>
        The example above displays how we assign an ID to the paragraph element
        and later use the ID selector in the stylesheet to select the paragraph
        and apply the style to it.
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
