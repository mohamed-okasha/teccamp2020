      <h2 class="contentTitleHtml">Your first HTML tag</h2>
      <p>
        However, we haven’t written any HTML tags yet. To do that, let’s wrap
        the Hello world! text in h1 tags, like this:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;h1&gt;
      </div>

      <p>
        You’ve now told the browser that you want the Hello world! text to be a
        heading.<br />
        Thus the browser applies some styling to it, basically increasing the
        size of the text.<br />
        So that’s how easy it is to start writing HTML.<br />

      <h2 class="contentTitleHtml">Writing a proper HTML document</h2>
      <p>
        But this isn’t actually a valid HTML document, as they should follow a
        clearly defined structure. For the purpose of this tutorial, I’m simply
        going to show it to you briefly, and then we’ll continue with the fun
        stuff.<br />
        Here’s how our Hello world! example should look like:<br />
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html>&lt;html> &lt;head> &lt;/head> &lt;body> &lt;h1>Hello
        world!&lt;/h1> &lt;/body>&lt;/html>
      </div>
      <p>
        <!-- You don’t have to worry about the  &lt;!DOCTYPE>, 
        &lt;html>; and  &lt;head> tag for now, as we’ll simply write our content in the  &lt;body> tag. 
        Let’s continue with that! -->
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2 class="contentTitleHtml">Paragraphs</h2>
      <p>
        Below the h1 tag we’ll add a paragraph. This tag is usually used for,
        well, paragraphs of text.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        &lt;h1>Hello world!&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Hello, and welcome to my website!&lt;p>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <h2 class="contentTitleHtml">Lists</h2>
      <p>
        Now let’s add a list. To do that, we need to add two different tags,
        &lt;ul>; and &lt;li>. The former stands for unordered list and the
        latter stands for list item. We’ll need to wrap the &lt;li>; tags inside
        the &lt;ul> tag.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        &lt;ul> &lt;li>Eat&lt;/li> &lt;li>Sleep&lt;/li>
        &lt;li>Code&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you change the &lt;ul> to an &lt;ol>, then the bullets will be
        replaced with numbers, as it stands for ordered list.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h2 class="contentTitleHtml">Input fields</h2>
      <p>
        Getting inputs from users is a critical activity on websites. Let’s add
        an input field.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        &lt;input type="text" placeholder="Enter your email" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now there are two new concepts to learn here: attributes and
        self-closing tags. The first one, attributes, provides additional
        information about the HTML elements.<br />

        In our case, we’re adding two attributes: type and placeholder. The type
        tells the browser that this should be a text field. Here, we could have
        chosen between a range of types (radio, select, checkbox, date) which
        would have turned it into completely different elements.<br />

        The placeholder dictates the help text inside the element.<br />

        Finally, the input tag is also a self-closing element (also known as a
        void element.), meaning it doesn’t consist of an opening and closing
        tag, but only one tag which closes itself.
